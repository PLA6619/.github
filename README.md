# Welcome, GSAPPers

This Github is primarily home to course material used for technical "hand-on" tutorials in Introduction to Urban Data and Informatics at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation taught in Fall 2024 (and potentially beyond). 

For more information on the class, as well as the syllabus and course sequence, refer to the course site at http://urbandata.me/urbaninformatics. 


## Dear Students

You will not be able to commit, submit, or do much on this Github other than pull materials for our hands-on. We'll introduce how to make a pull request early in the semester in Anaconda and Google Collab.
